# AI-Assisted Coding Workshop

Welcome to the 2-hour (hopefully), hands-on workshop focused on building a small AI-powered CRM using:

- Next.js 16
- React 19
- Tailwindcss
- SQLite + TypeORM
- Requesty (LLM) via the `ai` SDK

This project is intentionally incomplete.  
Your job is to finish it **with the help of AI coding assistants** such as Cursor, Copilot, Roo, Aider, etc.

## Structure

Assignments are in [docs/assignments](docs/assignments):

0. Warmup
1. Database & TypeORM
2. API Endpoints
3. UI
4. AI Integration
5. AI CRM Features
6. AI-Assisted Refactor

Each assignment is short and goal-oriented.  
**Your assistant should write most of the code.**

Good luck & have fun 🚀
