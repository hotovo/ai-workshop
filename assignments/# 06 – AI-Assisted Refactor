# 06 – AI-Assisted Refactor

## Goal

Use your AI assistant to refactor an intentionally messy function/component provided in the source.

## Tasks

- Open the designated ugly file (you will find it easily).
- Ask your AI assistant to:
  - Explain what it does.
  - Identify problems.
  - Propose a refactor.
- Implement one or more improvements.
- (Optional) Ask AI to generate unit tests for a refactored function.

You’re done 🎉
